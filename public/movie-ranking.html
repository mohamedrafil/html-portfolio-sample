<h3>    Pariyerum Perumal</h3>
<p> A Tamil drama film that follows the story of Pariyan, a young man from an oppressed caste who enrolls in law college with dreams of becoming a lawyer. He befriends Jothi Mahalakshmi, 
    a girl from an upper caste, which leads to severe backlash and harassment from her family.</p>

    <h3>F!ght Clu6</h3>
<p>    Super beautiful film. Really artistic. It follows an insomniac office worker who forms an underground f!ght clu6 with a soap salesman named Tyler Durden. 
    As the club grows, it evolves into something much more dangerous and anarchic.</p>
